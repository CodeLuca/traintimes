Final changes to TrainTimes

We are now saying farewell to this, our first Codrs' project.

This is the first, but possibly final changelog.

- Added select2 (The ability of station names dropping down as you type.)
- Fixed styling accross the live departures
- Fixed other minor bugs


- Thanks to Nick for his help with select2.
